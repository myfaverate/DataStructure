living in a large modern city or in the country?
"avoid the rush-hours" must be the slogan of large cities the world over. wherever you go, especially at weekends or on holidays, you'll find that the trains a re packed, streets crowded, buses queued, restaurant tables shared. moreover, the smallest unforeseen event like a power-cut, an exceptionally heavy snowfall or rainfall can bring about conditions of utter() inconvenience() and chaos.
city-dwellers are obliged by their environment to adopt a wholly unnatural way of life. they lose touch with nature and all the simple, good things of life like sunshine and fresh air at a premium . tall buildings block out the sun. traffic fumes pollute the atmosphere. the flow of traffic goes on unceasingly and the noise never stops.
the funny thing about it all in a large modern city is that you pay dearly for the "privilege" of living. the demand for accommodation is so great that it is of ten impossible for ordinary people to buy a house/flat of their own. furthermore, the cost of living is very high. just about everything you buy is likely to be more expensive than it would be in the country.
in addition, city-dwellers live under constant threat. the crime rate in most cities is very high. houses are often burgled. cities breed crime and violence and are full of places you would be afraid to visit at night. if you think about it, they are not really fit to live in at all. can anyone really doubt that the country is what man was born for and where he truly belongs?
